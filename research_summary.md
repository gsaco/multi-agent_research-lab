## Introduction

Synthetic data is increasingly used in healthcare to address data privacy and scarcity.

## Key Findings

- Apr 6, 2023 · In this paper, we present the cases for physical and statistical simulations for creating data and the proposed applications in healthcare and medicine. We discuss that while synthetics can promote privacy, equity, safety and continual ...
- Dec 1, 2024 · Objective: This review aims to identify the healthcare domains where synthetic data are currently generated, the motivations behind their creation, their future uses, limitations, and types... In this review paper, we examined existing ...
- Many critical variables aren’t in place: the quality of your data , the right evaluation methods, or how much trust and AI proficiency your users ... Adversarial inputs , like off-topic questions or jailbreak attempts (where users try to manipulate t...

## Ethical & Technical Challenges

- Data realism and validation: synthetic datasets must preserve distributional properties.
- Privacy re-identification risk: synthetic records may leak information if not carefully validated.
- Regulatory uncertainty: policies must catch up to synthetic data usage.

## Conclusion

Synthetic data shows promise for expanding training datasets and preserving patient privacy, but robust validation and policy safeguards are required to ensure safe adoption in healthcare.
